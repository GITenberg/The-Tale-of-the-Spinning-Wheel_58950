THE SPINNING-WHEEL
</p>

<p>
The spinning-wheel—symbol of the dignity
of woman’s labor.—What wealth
of memory gathers around the homely implement,
homely indeed in the good old
sense of the word—because belonging to
the home. Home-made and home-spun are
honorable epithets, replete with significance,
for in them we find the epitome of the lives
and labors of our foremothers. The plough
and the axe are not more symbolic of the
winning of this country from the wilderness,
nor the musket of the winning of its
freedom, than is the spinning-wheel in woman’s
hands the symbol of both. So symbolic
is it also of woman’s toil, of woman’s
distinctive and universal occupation, nay,
of woman herself, that the  “distaff side
of the house” has always been expressive of
the woman’s family, and “spinster” is still
the legal title of unmarried women in the
common law of England. Most ancient of
all household implements, it has been used
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
in one form or another by queen, princess,
and serving-maid, by farmer’s wife and
noble’s daughter, until it stands to-day a
silent witness to the fundamental democracy
of mankind.

The mutual dependence of spinning and
agriculture, of woman’s work and man’s, is
also strikingly illustrated by a carving on an
old sarcophagus in the Church of St. John
Lateran in Rome, depicting the Eternal
Father giving to Adam an instrument of
tillage, and to Eve a distaff and spindle.
Thus, coeval with man’s first appearance on
this earth, no written page of history, no
musty parchment or sculptured stone, is so
old that we cannot find upon it some traces
of the spindle and distaff with their tale of
joys and sorrows spun into the thread by the
fingers of patient women whose hearts beat
as our own to-day, in tune with the common
throb of humanity. Though we may strain
our eyes into the darkness of prehistoric
ages, when primeval woman used the tree-trunk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
of the forest for a distaff, we will
still find there some evidence of the use of
flax and hemp for threads and ropes. Even
in the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, belonging
to the Stone Age, we see their use
in various ways—in the fishing lines and
nets, in the cords for carrying heavy vessels,
and in the ropes necessary to the
erection of these very lake-dwellings themselves.
“Rough or unworked flax,” says
Keller,  “is found in the lake-dwellings
made into bundles, or what are technically
called heads, and ... it was perfectly clean
and ready for use.”

Stepping across the threshold of history,
we learn that sixty-five centuries ago there
lived in Egypt a king of the recently discovered
first dynasty, who, as his name,
Merneit-Ata, signifies, put his trust in the
goddess Neith, the all-sustaining mother of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
the universe; and in his tomb to-day has
been found a large upright slab, five feet
high, whereon are carved the emblems of
this goddess—two arrows crossed on an
upright distaff. Here, in the dim morning
of history, we find the distaff already honored
as the sacred symbol of this feminine divinity,
in whose eternal motherhood the Egyptians
vaguely recognized that mysterious
Power from which all things proceed. This
was no prehistoric age of barbarism, for in
the University Museum in London are now
to be seen the relics of this long lost first
dynasty, unearthed at Abydos within the last
four years by Dr. Flinders Petrie—relics
of a civilization already far advanced. We
stand face to face with their weapons of war
and of the chase, their household implements,
their exquisitely carved ivories and
gold jewelry and coin, their very clothing of
fine linen, the work of the spinsters of those
days, and the brain reels with the thought
that even before them there were generations
upon generations of human beings living in
organized societies and practising the arts
and engaged in the occupations of a high
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
order of civilized life. The whole course
of the first dynasty is now laid bare to us,
and we find that its beginning in 4700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
is modern history compared with the periods
of development that must have gone before,
for there is proof positive that even before
this dynasty, ten other kings reigned in
Egypt, and other hands grew flax on the
banks of the Nile and spun and wove it into
Egypt’s far-famed linen. In ancient Egypt
linen occupied a most important place; it
was worn by all classes, alive or dead, and
it was the only material that the priestly
orders were allowed to wear. We have
all seen the beautiful mummy linen found
wrapped around the mummies even of the
most remote antiquity; and we know that
only the best that Egypt could produce
would be wound around the sacred bodies
of their dead. This mummy-linen was not
spun on a wheel, but on a hand-distaff, called
sometimes a rock, such as the women of
India use to this day in spinning the fine
thread of India muslin, and such as was
also used by the children of our American
colonists while tending sheep and cattle in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
the field. The spinning-wheel as we know
it is of much later date. It does not appear
until the fifteenth century,—although the
date of the first wool-wheel is placed by one
authority in the fourteenth
century,—before
which time all spinning
of wool, flax, and cotton
was done on the
primitive distaff tucked
under the left arm in
the way so familiar to
us in pictures of peasant
girls and Greek
maidens spinning as they walk. Woman’s
first distaff was the trunk of a tree; her
spindle a rude stick, on which she wound
and twisted the yarn as her fingers laboriously
pulled and shaped it from the flax
wrapped around the trunk. From this distaff
of nature it was but a step to the manufactured
distaff of history. This distaff
was a staff about three feet long; the lower
end was held between the left arm and the
side; the upper end was wrapped with
the material to be spun. The thread was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
passed through, and guided by, the fingers
of the left hand, and was drawn and twisted
by those of the right, and wound on the
suspended spindle, made so as to be revolved
like a top, which completed the twist by its
own impetus and weight. The illustration
shows a distaff of the fifteenth century supported
by a rude stand, leaving the left arm
free to hold the spindle. In this slow and
simple fashion the clothing of all the world
was spun before the fifteenth century, and
still is spun to-day in many lands. The
spinning-wheel simply took the distaff as
it was, and attached a wheel and treadle to
revolve the spindle; and
the vast machines of
modern industry merely
elaborate and multiply
into many spindles this
simple device of previous
ages. The principle remains
absolutely the same,
so much so that we may
say that from tree-trunk
to modern factory
the methods of preparing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
and spinning flax have changed the least of
all the industries, the sculptures of ancient
Egypt depicting processes which are easily
recognizable as those practised to-day not
only in Egypt, but also by the modern Finn,
Lapp, Norwegian, and Belgian flax-grower.
The paintings in the grotto of El Kab show
the pulling, stocking, tying, and rippling of
flax just as it is done in Egypt now; and
our own colonists of a hundred years ago
followed precisely the same methods as the
Egyptian, who preceded him in the world’s
history by sixty-five hundred years. Pliny’s
description of Egyptian flax-culture and
preparation reads like an account of the
labors of our own foremothers; and the
walls of ancient tombs are covered with
pictures of the old familiar process. Egyptian
flax went to all parts of the world and
occupied a foremost place as an article of
commerce, for linen was the staple fabric for
clothing of all the ancient peoples. Pieces
of linen are still found clinging to skeletons
in the tombs of the Chaldeans, and it was
the national dress of the Babylonians and
Persians. All who are familiar with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
Bible know the importance accorded to flax
and the flax-spinner among the Hebrews.
Joseph did not need to go to Pharaoh to be
clothed “in vestures of fine linen,” if the
women of his time were as deft at spinning
as those women of a later day who brought
their offerings to the furnishing of the tabernacle
in the wilderness. “All the women
that were wise-hearted did spin with their
hands, and brought that which they had
spun, both of blue and of purple and of scarlet
and of fine linen. And all the women
whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
goat’s hair;” “wise-hearted,” because in
them “the Lord put wisdom and understanding
to know how to work all manner
of work for the service of the sanctuary”—guided
in their handiwork by the spirit of
God, which fills not only poet and prophet,
but artist and artisan as well. What a hum
there must have been in the Israelitish camp
as the women set hands to the spindle and
took up the distaff, and the sound of many
feet went through the tents, as they walked
back and forth, pulling out the long threads
that were to hang in beautiful fabrics of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
embroidered woollen and linen cloth around
about the tabernacle! “Thou shalt make
the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine
twined linen.... The length of one curtain
shall be eight and twenty cubits, and
the breadth of one curtain four cubits; And
thou shalt make curtains of goats’ hair to
be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven
curtains shalt thou make. The length of
one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits.” A
hanging for the door was also made of
“fine twined linen.” A cubit was about
one and eight tenths of a foot: the amount
of laborious spinning represented by those
curtains will be better understood when
we see later on the slowness of the process;
and yet so much was sent in that
Moses was obliged to give commandment,
saying, “Let neither man nor woman make
any more work for the offering of the
sanctuary.” Thus the Hebrew sanctuary
of God, the sacred place of the ark, was
built up, in this fifteenth century before
Christ, on the foundations of woman’s
labor.

<p class="caption">ARACHNE

<p>
Let us turn for a moment to Greece.
Once more we find woman’s handiwork
holding an honorable place, for the patron
goddess of spinning, weaving, and needle-work
is none other than Pallas Athene, the
warrior goddess of wisdom, founder and
protector of Athens, and herself
a spinner acknowledging no rival
among gods or men. Who does
not know how the full fury of her
godhead was let loose upon the
luckless Arachne, that mortal woman
who dared challenge her to a
competition in spinning and weaving?
Overhearing Arachne’s boast
that not even Pallas Athene herself
could surpass the beauty of her handiwork,
and that she would try her skill with the
goddess, or suffer the penalty of defeat, the
wrathful divinity assumed the form of an old
woman, and tried to induce the reckless girl
to desist. Arachne persisted in her defiance,
even when the goddess revealed herself in
all her majesty. They then proceeded to
the competition. Ovid tells us how they
wrought, each surpassing the other in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
wonderful living pictures woven into the
web, until at last the insulted goddess shattered
the mortal’s loom to atoms, and revealed
to Arachne the full extent of her
impiety. Unable to endure the thought of
her guilt and shame, she hanged herself
forthwith. The goddess pitied her as she
hung, and touching her said: “Live: and
that you may preserve the memory of this
lesson, continue to hang, both you and your
descendants, to all future times.” To this
day the spider, Nature’s busy spinner, bears
witness to her fate, and to the outraged
dignity of the goddess who thus honored the
spinster’s art by competing therein with a
mortal. Surely the much abused epithet of
“spinster” is entitled to respect, more especially
as this divine spinster honored also
the unmarried state in choosing ever to
“pursue her maiden meditations fancy
free.”

<p>
Thus does Theocritus apostrophize the
distaff:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“O distaff, practised in wool-spinning, gift of the blue-eyed Minerva,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span></p>
<p>Labor at thee is fitting to wives who seek the good of their husbands!</p>
<p>Trustfully come thou with me to the far famous city of Neleus,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So that, O distaff of ivory cunningly fashioned, I give thee</p>
<p>Into the hands of the wife of Nicias, the skilled and the learned!</p>
<p>So shalt thou weave mantles for men and transparent tissues for women.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And at the sight, O my distaff, shall one woman say to another:</p>
<p>Surely great grace lies in trifles, and gifts from friends are most precious!”</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
This recalls Alcandra’s gift of a golden
distaff to Helen of Troy; and an interesting
companion picture to these ancient Greeks
is our own Benjamin Franklin, who thus
presents a spinning-wheel to his sister in
a letter dated Jan. 6, 1736:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,—I am highly pleased
with the account Captain Freeman gives me
of you. I always judged from your behavior
when a child, that you would make a good,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
agreeable woman, and you know you were
ever my peculiar favorite. I have been
thinking what would be a suitable present
for me to make, and for you to receive, as I
hear you are grown a celebrated beauty.
I had almost determined on a tea-table;
but when I consider that the character of a
good house-wife was far preferable to that
of only being a pretty gentlewoman, I concluded
to send you a <i>spinning-wheel</i>, which
I hope you will accept as a small token of
my sincere love and affection. Sister, farewell,
and remember that modesty, as it
makes the most homely virgin amiable and
charming, so the want of it infallibly renders
the most perfect beauty disagreeable and
odious. But when that brightest of female
virtues shines among other perfections of
body and mind, in the same person, it makes
the woman more lovely than an angel.
Excuse this freedom and use the same with
me. I am, dear Jenny,
</p>

<p class="signature">
“Your loving brother,<br />
<span class="i4">
“<span class="smcap">B. Franklin</span>.”</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Compare Franklin’s sentiments emphasized
still further in Poor Richard’s
Almanac:—
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="i1">A large, an useful and a grateful Field.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Fancy the horror which would congeal
the soul of Poor Richard to-day at the
sight of woman stepping boldly outside that
“large Field” of the kitchen and spinning-room!
In the eyes of both Greek and
American, the woman plying spindle and
distaff was more nobly and graciously employed
than the spoiled beauty gossiping
over the teacups, for, says Richard,—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Many estates are spoiled in the getting,</p>
<p>Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Nor should we forget the august Fates
themselves, who spin the thread of human
destiny, weaving it into the web of universal
life, and cutting here and there a thread as
each mortal fulfils his allotted hour,—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“And sing to those who hold the vital shears,</p>
<p>And turn the adamantine spindle round,</p>
<p>On which the fate of gods and men is wound.”</p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Here we see the spindle as the emblem of
human destiny, and always in the hands of
women. Witness the three Norns, likewise,
of our own northern ancestors, who sit
around the tree Igdrasil and spin out the
world’s life on their whirring spindle.
</p>

<p>
If we ask more we need only turn to
Homer, the inimitable reflector of the customs
of his day. In his verse the spinner
lives again, as she spins the fine white linen
and gorgeous colored wool. Beautiful are
the pictures she weaves into the cloth,
stories of gods and demi-gods and heroes.
Odysseus, entering the feasting hall of the
Phæacians, is transfixed with wonder at
its splendor; its seats, throughout all their
length, were spread with the marvellous
work of the Phæacian maidens, showing
radiant in the torchlight, for the Phæacian
women far exceeded all others in this household
art. Did not the Phæacian queen
recognize on Odysseus the very garments
she herself and her maidens had made?
And all the while loyal-hearted Penelope
sat at home and wove her web to keep off
suitors, not to catch them, though Shakespeare
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
rather sneeringly remarks that “all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did
but fill Ithaca full of moths.” Evidently
spinning and the making of the household
garments were not beneath the dignity
of royal fingers in those old Greek days.
Queenly indeed were these occupations,
and right royal these distaffs of ivory and
gold, the gifts of kings and poets, the symbols
of woman’s dominion. Was not the
wool basket even of Helen of Troy lipped
with gold? And in the excavations on the
site of Troy to-day are found innumerable
spindle-whorls of terra-cotta; and in the later
excavations Dr. Schliemann found, twenty-eight
feet below the surface in the Royal
Mansion, a distaff eleven inches long to
which a quantity of blackened woollen thread
was still adhering. In those days of war
and pillage the garments a man wore were
the best tokens of his identity; the handiwork
of the matron and her daughters was
an individual seal set, as it were, upon the
lives of their male relatives; home-made and
home-spun were their garments, not turned
out by the dozen, ready-made from a factory.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
Penelope sees through the wiles of the false
Odysseus when he describes the garments
she had made for the real one. This custom
of the matron weaving the household
cloth has thus given the Greek poets a
favorite means of recognition of lost relatives
which is certainly more poetic than
the worn-out device of the “strawberry-mark”
on the “long-lost brother.” Even
the water nymphs practise weaving; Circe
also, and Calypso; mortals and immortals;
yea, the mighty Hercules himself threw down
his club and spun for love of Omphale:
thus do Greek mythology and literature
reflect the importance of spindle and distaff
in the home-life of the Greeks, who,
as we have learned, recognized the value
and the dignity of woman’s labor in believing
it to be under the particular tutelage
and protection of the dread daughter of
Zeus.
</p>

<p>
The Romans copied the Greeks in this
as in many other things. They borrowed
the spinster-goddess outright and called
her Minerva to hide the plagiarism. Our
friend Poor Richard says:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“When great Augustus ruled the World and Rome,</p>
<p>The Cloth he wore was spun and wove at Home,</p>
<p>His EMPRESS ply’d the Distaff and the Loom.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
Richard is borne out by another authority,
who states that “Cæsar Augustus wore
clothes made by his wife or daughter.”
The hapless Lucretia, wife of Collatinus,
Tarquin’s nephew, and Consul of Rome
in 509 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, “was found spinning when
her husband visited her from the camp.”
Gracious pictures these, of haughty Roman
matrons, wives of consuls and emperors,
spinning and weaving their husbands’
togas. It is not often that we get such
cosy and homelike thoughts of Rome,
whose very name recalls naught but flashing
legions and the clash of swords on
brass.
</p>

<p>
And the women of the north, where the
family was the unit of society and the village
was a cluster of homesteads knit together
by the ties of kindred—was the
spinning-wheel heard in this land of our
own ancestors? In the poetic diction of
the Norsemen, with its expressive double
substantives, we find that the maiden is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
called the “linen-folded,” that is, she who
is clothed or draped in linen. In the saga
called “Gunnlaug the Worm-tongue,” it
is written:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Dead in mine arms she droopeth,</p>
<p>My dear one, gold-ring’s bearer;</p>
<p>For God hath changed the life-days</p>
<p>Of this lady of the linen.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
She who was folded in linen was the maker
of that linen; and the beautiful flowing
draperies of Norse and Saxon women and
the tunics of the men are as true witnesses
to their homely occupations as the drapery
of the Greeks. Was it not the doom of the
warrior maiden Brynhild, the disobedient
Valkyr, to become a woman and sit by the
fire and spin? For the rough nature of the
North revolted from feminine occupations,
and this warrior daughter of Wotan saw in
spinning only deep humiliation and disgrace.
Thus the ancient northern literature is also
full of pictures of the women spinning their
household linen, spinning their wedding
linen, spinning the linen of husbands and
sons. Noble ladies in the halls of earl
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
and thane, wives in the lowlier homes of
simple freemen, and in the cots of peasant
and thrall—they all spun and wove for the
needs of the home. What music-lover can
ever forget Wagner’s picture of the northern
maids of later days assembled in a spinning-bee
to spin the wedding linen for one
of their number? The merry hum of the
wheels so exquisitely copied by orchestra
and chorus, interrupted now and then by
Senta’s plaintive song of the supernatural
lover who has drawn her thoughts away
from her betrothed,—surely this spinning-chorus
from the “Flying Dutchman” will
live as long as music lives, and will remain
a representative instance of this beautiful
northern custom.
</p>

<p>
Again, in the rush-strewn hall of mediæval
knight or baron hung with tapestry,
the work of his lady and her dependants,
depicting his deeds and those of his ancestors,
we read the same tale of the spinning-wheel
and distaff with its allied arts
of weaving and embroidery.
</p>

<p>
Nay, did she not write history, too, this

But our own immediate foremothers
beckon us, and we must linger no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
in ancient times and foreign lands. What
have the spinning-wheels here to tell us, as
they lie gathering the dust of a century
in some old musty garret—though an irate
New England house-wife might declare
that not even the dust of a week ever gathered
in her garret—or are brought down
to the “best parlor,” where they stand in
honorable retirement tied up with ribbon?
We know that at least every other one
of them must have “come over” in the
Mayflower, else how could so many yarns
have been spun regarding the capacity
of our ancestral ship? Here is a wool-wheel<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
(see illustration), not so old as many
others, perhaps, but all the more interesting
for that, inasmuch as it proves how recently
the real old homespun held its place
amongst us. This wheel is a little out
of the common. It was made by one
William Hopkins, a resident of Litchfield,
for his daughter, Nicy Melinda, about 1825.
William Hopkins was a direct descendant
of Joseph Harris, one of Litchfield’s pioneers,
who fell a victim to the tomahawk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
on Harris Plains in 1723. He had married
Mary Hopkins of West Hartford, and lived
just below the Symington Cottage. His
daughter Abigail married a cousin Asa
Hopkins, and their son Harris married
Margaret Peck, sister of Paul Peck, “the
mighty hunter,” and became the father of
William Hopkins of the spinning-wheel.
William was a clever mechanic, and made
this wheel to suit Nicy’s particular fancy.
It has two heads instead of one,—a new
and an old fashioned one,—and the edge of
the wheel is narrow and has a little groove
in it instead of being broad and flat. Nicy
Melinda married John A. Woodruff, and
lived on a farm this side of the Town-house
first; then they sold out there and came
into Litchfield, where they took up a residence
on West Street. She died in 1888.
She was Woodruff’s second wife, and her
step-daughter, Mrs. Abbie M. Woodruff
Newcomb, has loaned to the Litchfield
Historical Society a collection of linen
spun and woven by her. It consists of
sheets, pillow-slips, as they were called, and
table-cloths; and there is also a red broadcloth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
cloak entirely home-made. Her reel
is also still in existence, and has been presented
to this Society. The illustration
shows the marking on the linen worked by
her in black sewing-silk, the fine threads
being counted at every stitch. Think of
the labor represented by every inch of this
linen, whose sheen is hardly surpassed by
the finest silk or satin, made on a lonely
Connecticut farm by a busy woman, for
whom it was only one of innumerable other
tasks. Perhaps we had best pause here to
outline this process of linen manufacture,
that we may the better understand what the
work of women like Nicy Melinda meant to
our country in her time, but more particularly
in the earlier times of the colonies
and the Revolution. In speaking of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
patriotic devotion of the men in our war
for independence, of their bravery in battle,
their dignity and wisdom in the council-hall,
their patient endurance of every hardship
and privation, we must not forget that
their ability to meet these demands and to
be what they were, was due to the independence
of their homes of every outside
help in supplying the necessaries of life,
and this independence was due solely to
the patient industry, the unceasing and voluminous
manual labor of our grandmothers
from their earliest childhood to their death.
Every home farm supplied its own food and
drink, medicine, fuel, lighting, clothing, and
shelter. The very term “linen” as employed
by our ancestors, meant the home-made
article, “holland” always signifying
that which was imported. Almost every
article, in short, of household use and consumption
was home-made, and home-made
by the women. Women’s hands made all
the supplies of soap and candles; they distilled
all the medicines from the herbs of
the field; they stocked the larder with pies
and pickles, jams and jellies and preserves;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
they brewed the mead and metheglin, and
all other household drinks; they churned
the butter and made the cheese; they ran
bullets, as we very well know in Litchfield,
where the leaden statue of George III.,
torn down from the Bowling Green, New
York, and hurried thither, was melted by
Litchfield’s patriot women in the back orchard
of Oliver Wolcott; and lastly, they
spun into thread and yarn the flax and
wool that was raised on the farm, and then
knitted every pair of stockings and mittens,
wove every inch of linen and woolen cloth,
and cut and made every stitch of clothing
worn by a family which generally numbered
ten or a dozen Johns and Hezekiahs
and Josiahs and Hepzibahs and Mehitable
Anns. No wonder a man could go to the
war for his country’s independence, when
he left Independence herself at home in the
person of his wife.

No properly brought up maiden of those
days would think herself prepared to marry
until she had collected in her “linen-chest”
all the necessaries of housekeeping spun,
and often woven, by herself, besides all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
things necessary to complete her trousseau.
Ten pairs of linen sheets at least she must
have, and she must “knit a pillow-slip full
of stockings” before she could even think
of the happy event. Thus the time of a
young girl was largely used in spinning her
own wedding outfit,—whether rich or poor,
it made no difference. The wealthiest spun
with the poorest, and you will find the
spinning-wheel of both kinds in the musty
old inventories of estates of every value,
and in the “setting-out” of every bride,
whether she left a farmer’s lonely homestead,
or the proud colonial mansion of the
well-to-do; the millionaire was an unknown
species then.

</div><p>
Let us now see how much work there
was in this spinning, which was only one
of those numberless other things our grandmothers
had to do.
</p>

Flax was sown in May, and when the
plants were three or four inches high, they
were weeded by the women and children,
walking barefoot on account of the tender
stalks. At the end of June, or in July, it
was pulled up very carefully by the roots
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
by men and boys and laid out to dry, being
turned several times in the sun: this operation
was called “pulling and spreading.”
Then came the “rippling,” a process by
which the stalks of flax were drawn with
a quick stroke through an iron wire comb
with coarse teeth: this broke off the seed-bolls,
which were caught in a sheet and
saved for the next year’s crop. The flax
was still in the field, where it was now tied
in bundles, called “beats” or “bates,”
and stacked in a tent-shaped stack called a
“stook.” When the stacks were dry they
were again treated with water to rot the
leaves. This was called “retting;” the
bates of flax were piled in running water
in a solid heap, and left for about five days,
when they were taken up and the rotting
leaves removed. When cleaned and dried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
the flax was once more tied in bundles.
It was then broken by men on the great
flax-brake in order to separate the fibres
and get out from the centre the hard, woody
“hexe” or “bun.” This clumsy instrument
need not be described here, further
than to say that a heavy beam set with
slats, hinged to an under beam also set
with slats corresponding to the intervals of
the upper one, was weighted and allowed to
fall on the flax laid in between. The flax
was usually broken twice, then “scutched”
or “swingled” with a swingling block
and knife to remove any remaining bits of
bark. The clean fibres were then made
into bundles called “strikes,” which were
swingled again, the refuse from the process
being used for coarse bagging. The
“strikes” were sometimes “beetled,” or
pounded in a wooden trough over and over
until soft. The flax was now ready for the
process of hackling or hetcheling, which
required great dexterity on the part of the
hetcheler. The flax fibres were carefully
drawn towards the hetcheler through the
teeth of the hetchel (see illustrations, pages
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
33 and 34, taken from originals in the Litchfield
Historical Society), thus pulling out
the fibres into long continuous threads and
combing out the shorter threads. This implement
has given its name to that process
of “heckling” so familiar, for instance,
to hen-pecked husbands when lectured by
irate wives. Our inelegant but expressive
modern slang would say she “combed him
down.” These are the “combs” she would
use, figuratively at least, if not actually.

After the first hackle, six other finer ones
were frequently applied, and the amount of
good fibre left after all this hackling, even
from a huge mass of raw material, was
very small; but a very
large quantity of linen
thread could be spun from
this small amount. The
fibres were then sorted
according to fineness by a
process called “spreading
and drawing.” Now at
last the flax was ready
for the wheel, and was
wrapped around the distaff;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
the spinner seated herself at this familiar
implement and spun out a long, even
thread from the mass of fibre on the distaff.
This thread she wound on bobbins as she
spun it, and when the bobbins were full,
she wound it off on a reel into knots and
skeins. This was the clock-reel, which
ticked when a certain number of strands
had been wound in a “knot”; then the
spinner would pause and tie the knot, and
if at that moment some ardent admirer
were watching this pretty and graceful occupation,
it is not at all likely that the busy
spinster could escape a more tangible proof
of his admiration, for it is written that “He
kissed Mistress Polly when the clock-reel
ticked.”

Doubtless John Alden
improved his opportunities
when he was told to
speak for himself; at
least, let us hope that
Priscilla did not have to
hint about everything.
</p>

<p>
It was a good day’s
work to spin two skeins
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
of twenty knots each, every knot having
usually forty threads. For this work a
woman earned eight cents a day and her
keep. In the valley of Wyoming, where
so many Connecticut families emigrated to
meet their terrible doom later on at the
hands of the Indians, a woman was paid six
shillings a week for her labor at spinning.
</p>

<p>
Before the threads could be woven they
had still to pass through a long and laborious
process of bleaching by soaking them
in many waters, then with hot water and
ashes over and over again, then in clear
water again for a week, then a final seething,
rinsing, beating, washing, drying, and
winding on bobbins, when they were at last
ready for the loom.

Such was the far from simple process
of flax-culture and spinning on the farm:
when we remember that wool culture and
spinning was scarcely less laborious, and
that the home weaving of both kinds of
thread has not yet been taken into the
account, we shall begin to realize what
it meant to the women of ’76 when they
voluntarily took oath to wear naught but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
homespun, they and their sons and their
daughters.
</p>

<p>
But there was much social enjoyment in
it too, and much interest excited by the
offering of prizes to efficient and rapid spinsters.
It was not unusual for a woman
in those days to tuck her baby under one
arm, tie her wheel behind her, and trot off
on horseback to spend the day in spinning
with a neighbor. Many a well-to-do matron
“had a touch so skilful that she could
spin two threads, one in each hand, while
she kept the treadle of her flax-wheel moving
with her foot, held the baby asleep
across her knees, and talked with her visitors.”
Or, when weather permitted, “the
wide hospitable door would be thrown open,
and the thrifty house-wife in afternoon dress
of mull or ‘taffety’ and a fine cambric
apron, would step back and forth before
the great wool-wheel set in the spaceway
spinning fine yarn while neighbors
dropped in.”

<p>
Speaking of two-handed wheels, I find the
following quaint advertisement in the Hartford
“Courant” for January 5, 1801:—
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>

</p>

<p>
“<i>N. B.</i> Two handed wheels are highly
recommended to young Women, as they

</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, Dec. 15.”
</p>
</div>

<p>
And then the spinning-bees and spinning
classes—the sewing circles of those days.
Both Connecticut and Massachusetts as
early as 1640 took legal steps to encourage
the culture and spinning of flax, and every
family was ordered to spin a certain amount
of flax a year on penalty of a fine, and often
prizes were offered for quantity and quality.
On Boston Common the spinsters would
sometimes meet with their wheels, and sit
them down to spin—rich and poor alike, to
the number, once, of three hundred. Think
you the haughty spinsters of Boston would
do the like to-day? On one occasion they
were preached to by the minister in a long
and profitable sermon, and a collection of
£453 was taken up. This most edifying
event took place in 1754.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sermons and spinning evidently went
hand in hand, for I find in the Litchfield
“Monitor” for May 16, 1798, the following
item of news:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letter_head">
“<span class="smcap">South Farms</span>, May 7.
</p>

<p>
“On Wednesday, the 2d instant visited
at the house of the Rev. <i>Amos Chase</i>, about
60 of his female friends parishioners:—Who
made the very acceptable presentation
of seventy run of Yarn to his family.
In the course of the decent and cordial
socialties of the afternoon, the ladies were
entertained by their Pastor with a sermon
adapted to the occasion,—from these words,
Gen. xxxi. 43, ‘<i>What can I do, this day,
unto these my daughters?</i>’”
</p>
</div>

<p>
From an address by the Rev. Grant
Powers on the occasion of the centennial
anniversary of the town of Goshen, Connecticut,
in 1838, I quote the following
account of a great spinning-match among
the ladies about 1772:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“There arose a <i>spinning-match</i>, among
the young married ladies, at the house of
Nehemiah Lewis.... The trial was at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
foot-wheel in spinning linen. The conditions
were previously defined and agreed
to, viz.: They might spin during the whole
twenty-four hours if they chose. They
were to have their distaffs prepared for them,
and their yarn reeled by others. Upon the
first trial at Lews’ house many did well.
The wife of Stephen Tuttle spun five runs,
which were equal to two and a half days’
labour when on hire. Several others spun
four runs each; but Mrs. Tuttle came off
victor. But this aroused the ambition of
some of the unmarried ladies, and Lydia
Beach, the daughter of Dea. Edmund
Beach, of East-street, was the first to
come forward and take up the gauntlet.
She spun from early dawn to nine o’clock
in the evening. She had her distaffs prepared,
her yarn reeled, and her food put
into her mouth. She spun in this time
seven runs, three and a half days’ labour,
and took the wreath from the brow of Mrs.
Tuttle.”
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
Mr. Powers adds in a foot-note,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Some of our Matrons say that ten runs
were a week’s labour; if so Miss Lydia
performed the labour of four days and one-fifth
of a day in one day.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Upon hearing of the exploit of Miss
Beach [he continues in his address] the
wife of Capt. Isaac Pratt, of the South
part of the town, came upon the arena.
Between early dawn and the setting of the
sun, she had actually spun six runs, but
at this moment her husband interfered, and
peremptorily forbade her proceeding further.
She sat down, and wept like a child, when
she ought to have rejoiced, that she possessed
a husband, in whose eyes her future
health and happiness were more precious,
than the brief applause which might arise
from success in that contest.”
</p>
</div>

<p>
He goes on to say that Lydia Beach became
the wife of Jesse Buel, son of Capt.
Jonathan Buel, “while her garland was
yet fresh upon her brow; but the doating
husband was destined to see it wither down
to the grave, for Lydia never enjoyed health
from the hour of her triumph.”
</p>

<p>
From this it is evident that the spinning-wheel
as well as the sewing-machine has
had its victims. It was well for these toiling
women of the pioneer towns if they had
husbands thoughtful enough to stop in time
the self-sacrifice of daily labor at the wheel,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
as well as in this spinning-match for glory
only. Of such pious women Chaucer could
scarcely have said:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Deceite, weepynge, spynnynge, God hath give</p>
<p>To wymmen kyndely that they may live.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
For not only did these women live, but also
their families and their country because of
their spinning.
</p>

<p>
The Stamp Act year was drawing on,
and the storm of indignation was beginning
to rumble in the distance, soon to burst like
a tornado on England’s commerce with her
colonies. From Massachusetts to South
Carolina the colonies were alive with patriotic
societies of women called “Daughters
of Liberty,” who banded themselves together
with the agreement to drink no tea,
and wear only what their own hands could
spin and weave. Among the Daughters of
Stratford, Connecticut, were two children
of a Tory father, of the elder of whom it is
written, “that having lost her thimble she
would not buy another, as it would be an
imported article; and Polly, the little sister,
scorning an English needle, learned to sew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
with a thorn.” Think of that, all ye modern
women to whom sewing is enough of a
“thorn” in itself without using another to
sew with.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere these Daughters met together
to spin, once to the number of seventy in
one place. In Rowley, Massachusetts,
“thirty-three respectable ladies,” as the
story runs, “met at sunrise with their
wheels to spend the day at the house of the
Reverend Jedediah Jewell, in the laudable
design of a spinning-match.” Of course
the Rev. Jedediah preached to them; but
they were also given bodily sustenance in
the form of a “polite and generous repast.”
All honor to these Daughters of
the olden time whose spinning-wheels did
surely spin out their country’s glorious destiny!
“Queens of Homespun,” Horace
Bushnell called such women, “out of whom
we draw our royal lineage.” And to-day,
another patriotic society of forty thousand
modern Daughters, their descendants,
have surely honored themselves in choosing
for their insignia this very spinning-wheel
and distaff, this symbol of their grandmother’s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
toil and self-sacrifice and patriotism;
for in that little emblem are embodied
all the blood and tears, the sorrow, the
rejoicing, and the patient, steadfast labor
of the women of the American Revolution.
The Rev. Mr. Powers in his centennial
address, after eulogizing the men,
thus speaks of these patriot women of our
land:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Nor do we speak of these <i>men</i> only,
but their <i>mothers</i>, their <i>wives</i> and their
<i>daughters</i> were like them.... They sustained
their full share in all the trials and
dangers of the Ocean, of the wilderness,
and of war! Their courage in times of
peril, and their fortitude in trials never forsook
them! They gave up their husbands
and their sons for the cause of God and
their country, and their example was all
powerful. And this was true, not only
of <i>Pilgrim</i> women, but of women in the
Revolution. This town possessed them.
I will give one instance of this that it may
be a memorial of her. Abraham Parmele
was a warm patriot in the Revolution ...
but in this it is said, he was thrown into the
shade by the patriotism of his wife Mary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
Stanley that was. She was fixed in the
righteousness of the cause of the colonies,
and when war broke out, she said they
would prevail! She said she could pray
for the cause of America; and not in the
darkest period of the conflict, when many
faces were pale, and many hands were on
their loins, did this woman’s confidence fail
her in the least,—and her actions corresponded
with her words. Four different
times did she fit out her own son Theodore
for the battlefield, and gave him her parting
blessing; and with her own hands did she
make five soldiers’ blankets, not to sell, but
sent them a present to the poor soldiers, who,
after the battles of the day, had neither
bed nor covering for the night. Could
soldiers thus sustained ever relinquish the
cause of their country? Never!”
</p>
</div>

<p>
In Townsend, Massachusetts, it is said
that “a devoted mother and her daughters
did in a day and a night shear a black and a
white sheep, card from the fleece a gray wool,
spin, weave, cut, and make a suit of clothes
for the boy whom they were sending off to
fight for liberty.” W. J. Stillman in his
Autobiography tells of a similar instance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
occurring in the pastor’s family in Newport,
Rhode Island, in whose home his mother grew
up. Coming from such homes as these, no
wonder that the boys of ’76 won that fight.
</p>

<p>
But New England was not alone in her
encouragement of flax and wool culture.
Virginia, where wild flax grew in profusion,
was even earlier than Massachusetts
in arousing an interest in flax-spinning. In
1646, two spinning-schools were established
in Jamestown, and prizes were offered for
the best work, until the whole colony was engaged
in this home industry. Every great
and little plantation had its spinning-house,
where the female slaves were kept busily
spinning, the mistress herself joining in the
work. We are of course reminded of the
spinning-house at Mount Vernon, where
“Lady” Washington marshalled her dusky
spinners. It is said that she ravelled and
dyed her old silk gowns and silk scraps, and
had them woven into chair-covers. Sometimes
she did the reverse, weaving a dress
for herself out of ravelled cushions and the
General’s old silk stockings.
</p>

<p>
Madame Pinckney, another dame of high
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
degree, was actively instrumental in starting
the flax industries of South Carolina.

<p>
The German settlers of Germantown were
also great flax-growers, as attested by their
town-seal, the device of their leader, Father
Pastorius. And what we now know as
“Germantown” still testifies to their proficiency
in the wool industries.
</p>

<p>
The wives and daughters of the Swedish
colony, as early as 1673, employed themselves
in spinning wool and flax, and many
in weaving; and the excellence shown by
the wool and flax workers of New York occasioned
uneasiness in the mother-country,
which rightly saw in it the possible independence
of the colonies of all English
cloth and clothing.
</p>

<p>
The production and manufacture of cotton
was not taken up in this country until 1770,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
three years after the invention of the spinning-jenny
by Hargreaves. Cotton, in the
earliest times, was spun like flax, first on
the hand-distaff, and then
on a wheel like the flax-wheel.
For some time
after its introduction into
this country, it was far
more expensive, and considered
more of a luxury,
than linen. It was
called by the East Indian
name of “hum-hum.”
A work-pocket
in the Litchfield Historical
Society (see
illustration) contains
a piece of the first
cotton cloth made in
America. The pocket
is large and was worn
at the side, evidently to hold flax in while
spinning, for some flax still remains in it.
The growing and spinning of cotton cannot,
however, be counted among the truly colonial
industries.

The Stamp Act soon stirred all patriotic
Philadelphians to the resolve to eat no
“meat of the mutton kind,”—a resolve
rendered still more stern in 1775. A wool-factory
was fitted up, and, to quote Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle,<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> “an appeal was made
to the women to save the state. In a
month four hundred wool-spinners were at
work.” In the same year the Provincial
Congress made an appeal to the people for
thirteen thousand warm coats for the Continental
army, to be ready for the soldiers
when winter came. It was a time when
all preparations for the war seemed to be
in the most hopeless snarl, and army supplies
were scarce and often lacking. To-day
a contractor would make nothing of the
job, possibly in more senses than one; but
a hundred years ago the wool-wheels and
hand-looms were set humming by hundreds
of hearth-stones, and, writes Mrs. Earle
again, “the order was filled by the handiwork
of patriotic American women.” In the
record book of some New England towns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
may still be found the list of the coat-makers....
Every soldier volunteering for
eight months’ service was given one of these
homespun, homemade, all-wool coats as a
bounty. So highly were these ‘Bounty
Coats’ prized, that the heirs of soldiers who
were killed at Bunker Hill before receiving
their coats were given a sum of money
instead. The list of names of soldiers who
then enlisted is known to this day as the
‘Coat Roll,’ and the names of the women
who made the coats might form another roll
of honor. The English sneeringly called
Washington’s army the ‘Homespuns.’
They little knew the power and significance
of that title. Well did Horace Bushnell
call it “mother and daughter power.”
</p>

<p>
Thus we see that in New England the
culture, spinning and weaving of wool, as
well as flax, was as religiously encouraged
as in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and New York.
The great wool-wheel was as necessary an
implement in every household as the little
flax-wheel, for every home had by law to
contain one spinner. Children of all classes
were required to learn to spin wool, and met
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
on equal footing over their work. Homespun
became so universal a commodity that
imported woolens were not missed when
the time came to forbid them the country.
It was a process of many months of hard
labor to convert the raw fleece into the
“all-wool goods a yard wide” which we
cut up so recklessly to-day. Another old
saying, “dyed in the wool,” represents another
laborious process, that of dyeing the
wool with homemade dyes. All kinds of
homely flowers were used for these dyes, a
beautiful green being made from goldenrod
mixed with indigo. Blue, made from the
blue paper that wrapped the old sugar-loaf,
and from indigo bought from travelling
pedlers, was the favorite color, possibly
because the easiest to obtain; and the old
blue dye-pot stood constantly in the chimney
corner like the Frenchwoman’s <i>pot-au-feu</i>.
We cannot help wondering if the
coats of the “Homespuns” were blue.
And the familiar blue of the patriot army?
Was that also women’s work?
</p>

<p>
After the dyeing came the carding, a very
deft process, and also a very dirty one, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
the wool had first to be rubbed with melted
swine’s grease—three pounds of grease to
ten of wool. This process corresponded in
purpose and method to the hetcheling of
flax, as the wool was drawn into parallel
fibres through bent wire teeth set in a
leather or wooden rectangle, called a wool-card.
Here are the wool-cards of Maria
Tallmadge, second wife of Colonel Benjamin
Tallmadge, the famous major of
Connecticut’s Second Light Dragoons, the
friend of Lafayette and confidant of Washington;
they belong to the valuable collection
of the Litchfield Historical Society.
By these clumsy-looking implements the
wool was twisted into little rolls, and was
then ready for spinning.
</p>

<p class="caption">CARDS</p>
</div>

<p>
This wool-spinning called for the most
alert and graceful series of movements, to
which our foremothers owe in large part
their poise and dignity of carriage. The
little roll of wool was placed on the spindle,
the great wheel was given a quick turn, and
the spinner stepped quickly backward three
or four steps, holding the twisting yarn in her
left hand high above her head: then with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
quick forward movement she let it wind
around the bobbin, and the process was
repeated. An active spinner could spin six
skeins a day, and to do this it is estimated
that she walked with her backward and forward
steps over twenty miles.
</p>

<p>
Yarn was wound from the spindle on
clock-reels, and also on hand-reels called
“niddy-noddies.” To be knitted it had
also to be washed and cleaned.
</p>

<p>
To spin the finest yarn was a much desired
accomplishment among housewives.
It is said that one Mistress Mary Prigge
once spun a pound of wool into eighty-four
thousand yards—that is, nearly forty-eight
miles.
</p>

<p>
All these different manipulations lasted
many months, though they could be accomplished
in much shorter time; they also
furnished occupation for an entire family,
from the grandmother down to the children,
when on long winter evenings they all assembled
before the kitchen fire.

<p>
It is impossible here to go into the home
process of weaving this wool and linen
thread; but it was no less laborious than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
all that had gone before. Suffice it to say
that in almost every house throughout New
England, Pennsylvania, and Virginia the
hand-loom was to be found, and every
farmer’s daughter could weave as well as
spin, although weaving was not so wholly
woman’s work as was spinning. Homespun
linen after being woven had to undergo about
forty processes of bleaching, as it was still
light brown in color. It was often kept out
on the grass for weeks at a time, until at
least sixteen months had elapsed since the
planting of the flaxseed to the final evolution
of the finished sheet or pillow-case.
What modern linen is as firm, solid, and
close-woven, and capable of being used a
hundred years hence as this can be used to-day?
What needle-work so fine? One can
hardly believe that the same hands which
made the soap and greased the wool could
hem like that, embroider the finest edging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
and other work, make bead-bags, and knit
the daintiest lace. All-around women they
must have been to pass back and forth from
the coarsest to the finest labor, and to keep
their minds alert as well. Listen to one
Abigail Foote’s diary, in the year 1775, and

did 50 knots,—Made a Broom of Guinea-wheat
straw,—Spun thread to whiten,—Set
a Red dye,—Had two Scholars from
Mrs. Taylor’s,—I carded two pounds of
whole wool and felt Nationly,—Spun harness
twine, scoured the pewter.”

All this besides washing, cooking, weaving
tape, knitting, weeding, picking geese,
and making social visits. And yet we talk
about modern rush and hurry, and the
“strenuous life.” It is merely a change
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
of occupation. We hear it constantly said
of our ancestors’ fine needle-work, delicate
hand-writing, etc., “Oh, they had more
time to do such things.” Would not Abigail
Foote dispute that, think you? Also
Mrs. John May, a prominent Boston woman,
who writes in her diary for one day:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“A large kettle of yarn to attend upon.
Lucretia and self rinse, scour through many
waters, get out, dry, attend to, bring in, do
up and sort 110 score of yarn; this with
baking and ironing. Then went to hackling
flax.”

Now she was not an over-worked farmer’s
wife, but a city woman, the wife of a colonel.
I do not believe they had one bit more
time than we have. Manners and customs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
change, but this busy world was always
busy, and it is true of all ages that “woman’s
work is never done.” There are those who
regret the disuse of these homely occupations,
saying that the home has suffered
with the modern broadening of “woman’s
sphere.” They forget that a sphere must
round itself out on all sides, leaving the
centre at the same point: the rounding out
of woman’s sphere leaves her centre still
the home. And the home still centres in the
woman; the country still centres in the
home, and no mere change of womanly occupation
can alter God’s fundamental law
of human society. But for the comfort of
those who would still see woman spinning
as in the “good old times,” it is worthy of
note that in Deer Isle, Maine, the spinning-match
is still extant. True to patriotic
tradition, the wool-spinners there have
formed a “Martha Washington Benevolent
Society,” which for fifty years, without a
break, has held an annual spinning-match in
August, twenty or more women assembling
with their great wheels, and spinning with
all the old-time dexterity. One of their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
number is one hundred and two years old,
and during the past winter made, entirely
without help, four large patch-work bed-quilts,
double-bed size, and sold them at the
sale which accompanies the match. The
yarn which they spin through the year they
knit into stockings and mittens for home
use and for sale.
</p>

<p>
In New York City lives a family who are
now developing these homely industries to
their full artistic limits. One of the most
interesting exhibits in the National Exposition
of Children’s Work held in March,
1901, was a portière entirely hand-made by
the young son and daughter of Douglas
Volk, the artist, in their city home. The
wool was spun and dyed by Marian Volk
with vegetable dyes of her own making, and
the boy wove it on a genuine loom, one
hundred years old, brought from the heart
of Maine. The room in which they spin
and weave, with its home-made rugs,
antique chairs, and brass candlesticks, its
spinning-wheels, clock-reel, and loom, all in
daily use, might be taken for the “living-room”
of an old Maine farmhouse. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
artistic possibilities of the old spinning and
weaving were recognized a few years ago by
Mrs. Volk while living at Lovell, her summer
home in Maine, and she has successfully
established there her new industry of
home rug-making, every process of which is
marked with the sincerity of hand-work—a
noble handicraft indeed. Thus this time-honored
occupation still thrives in the East,
while in the remote and mountainous regions
in the South, handweaving and spinning are
still household arts—as also in many foreign
countries.
</p>

<p>
But here must end the tale of the spinning-wheel
in many ages and climes, though the
tale is not half told. We have seen the
centuries bear witness to the dignity of
woman’s manual labor, of which the old
dusty spinning-wheel is as glorious a symbol
as are the tattered battle-flags a token
of the soldier’s hard-fought field. Patriotism,
self-devotion, sacrifice—all speak to us
from the one and from the other. Woman’s
labor has supported the home, has filled the
breach in war-time, has clothed the world,
and continues to do so to-day. For though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
the spinning-wheel is mute, the sewing-machine
and the factory are not, and the
“Song of the Shirt” goes on forever. The
Daughters of Liberty spun for their country
in the days of ’76, and they have lived again
in every period of their country’s need—in
the Sanitary Commission, in the women’s
Red Cross Auxiliaries, in the “Dames”
and “Daughters” of to-day. Let us thank
God that we had such foremothers; thank
Him that they and the forefathers gave us a
country of which we may still be proud;
thank Him that their spirit is still alive in
our midst, for as the uprising of that spirit
drove the tyrant from our shores in 1776, so it
has ever since arisen, and still will rise to deliver
our country from the perils of the hour—the
peril from the greedy and corrupt
politician, the perils of popular ignorance
and luke-warm patriotism, and all other
perils consequent upon the loss of our forefathers’
ideals. May this spirit never die,
for the day of its disappearance is the day
of our country’s doom. It is the duty and
the privilege of our great Society to see
that “old New England” never fails us,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
for it is her spirit that has burned high in
the breast of American womanhood from
Bunker Hill till now, and there stands its
witness. Honor the old spinning-wheel and
all it signifies, and to the spinster:
</p>

and let her works praise her in the gates.”

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
